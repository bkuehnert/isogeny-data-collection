This file was used to collect basic information about isogeny classes as a part
of the 2019 CAD REU at Boise State. To use it, first install SageMath. Then,
edit isogeny.py to set your parameters and run `sage isogeny.py`.

Please note that this file was written to quickly collect preliminary data about
isogeny classes, and is by no means efficient.
